### Agents: An Open-source Frameworkfor Autonomous Language Agents



### METAGPT:META PROGRAMMING FOR MULTI-AGENTColLABORATIVE FRAMEWORK

Abstract

>Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through the use of multiagent driven by large language models (LLMs). However, existing LLM-based multi-agent worksprimarily focus on solving simple dialogue tasks, and complex tasks are rarely studied, mainly due tothe LLM hallucination problem.This type of hallucination becomes cascading when naively chainingmultiple intelligent agents. resulting in a failure to effectively address complex problems., Thererorewe introduce MetaGP an innovative framework that incorporates efhcient human workfilows asSpecifically.MetaGPTa meta programming approach into LLM-basedmulti-agent collaboration.encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts to enhancestructured coordinationSubsequently. it mandates modular outputs.empowering agents with domain expertise comparable tohuman professionals, to validate outputs and minimize compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPTleverages the assembly line paradigm to assign diverseroles to various agents. thereby establishina framework that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct complex multi-agent collaborativproblems.Our experiments on collaborativesoltware engineeringbenchmarks demonstrate thalMetaGPT generates more coherent and correct solutions comparedto existing chat-based multi-agensystems.This highlights the potential of integrating human domain knowledge into multi-agentsystems, thereby creating new opportunities to tackle complex rea-world challenges.
