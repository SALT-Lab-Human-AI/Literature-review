### Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior

https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442

**Abstract**

> Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.

### Metaagents: Simulating Interactions of Human Behaviors for LLM-Based Task-Oriented Coordination via Collaborative Generative Agents

**Abstract**

> Significant advancements have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks and social simulations. Despite this, their capacities to coordinate within task-oriented social contexts are under-explored. Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behavior and produce meaningful results. To bridge this gap, we introduce collaborative generative agents, endowing LLM-based Agents with consistent behavior patterns and task-solving abilities. We situate these agents in a simulated job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize their coordination skills. We propose a novel framework that equips collaborative generative agents with human-like reasoning abilities and specialized skills. Our evaluation demonstrates that these agents show promising performance. However, we also uncover limitations that hinder their effectiveness in more complex coordination tasks. Our work provides valuable insights into the role and evolution of LLMs in task-oriented social simulations.
